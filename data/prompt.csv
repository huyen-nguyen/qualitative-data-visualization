BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,5,"Prompt
 We are approaching the half-way point of the quarter, which means it is a good time to reflect on what we are learning. Below I have listed the learning objectives for the course. From this list, pick out all the objectives you have worked on. Once you choose the objectives you worked on, mention the activities you did to learn such as homework, major group assignment, group presentation, journal, out-of-class work or other activities. 
 
 The purpose of this journal is two-fold:
 
  I want you to document your learning, which we will do fully for the final portfolio.
 I want to know how effective I am as an instructor to help you reach these course goals.So if you don't include an objective, I'll assume we either haven't covered it or I need to teach it better.
 Learning objectives
 By the end of the course, students will be able to:
 
 Categorize features of effective visual representations
 Identify the different types of data and their constraints
 Relate different types of data to appropriate visualizations
 Manipulate, organize, and clean the data using simple algorithms
 Apply best practices for data management and formatting
 Report descriptive statistics
 Make an interactive data visualization for a web-page
 Author a report with data and visuals that addresses a research question
 Provide a constructive critique of a data visualization
 Be familiar with the ethical issues and power surrounding data
 Clarify responsible conduct for authoring documents with integrity
 Work effectively as a group to collaborate and share leadership throughout different stages of a project
 Contrast visualizations with other forms of communications"
BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,6,"Learning R can sometimes lead you to explore unexpected things. It is okay to play with the program and the code. In this journal, I want you to talk about a time that you explored in R. If you haven't played with R, take some time to do that and reflect on what happened.
 
 Describe playing with the R code and what you learned (5-7 sentences)."
BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,7,"For this journal I would you like you to reflect on our guest speaker's presentation. This is an open journal entry that you can reflect however you would like. Below are some questions you may choose to help you reflect:
 
  What parts of Etiowo's story do you identify with?
 Who benefits from having a data analysts in healthcare?
 How does a career in data visualization align with your goals?
 What remaining question do you have about a career in data science?
 Why is a data visualization career not appealing to many people?
 If you were not able to attend the speaker's presentation, find a person who does data visualization and read about their background or career from online sources. Reflect on that person's work and what parts you can or cannot relate to."
BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,8,"In 5-7 sentences, explain what has changed, since starting this course, in how you think about data visualization."
BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,9,"""Without data, you are just another person with an opinion."" - Dr. (Links to an external site.)Robin Angotti, UWB
 
 Hopefully through this course you see that data is all around and power can come from being able to organize data to gain information and insights. However, as a means for communicating to an audience, visualized data mostly benefit the people who know how to interpret the graphics; many people have not developed a visual literacy to understand the figures we have made. For this journal entry, I want you to reflect on data visualizations as a means for communication.
 
 Is there a paradox to data visualization? Why are photos like those in the documentary Chasing Ice (Links to an external site.) more impactful to a broad audience than any data graph? Why are people, who want to see evidence of a claim, easily misled by data visualizations? Why do media companies often use data graphics to get our attention rather than accurately represent information?
 
 In 5-7 sentences, what function should data visualization serve for communication?"
