BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,20194,2,1,"Address the following questions to help me understand your perspective:
 
 Why are you taking this course?
 What do you hope to learn from this course?
 What is one thing I should know about you to help you learn?","Why are you taking this course?
 
 I am taking this course because I am currently interning for a digital marketing firm that focuses on search engine optimization. Within this internship I have been exposed to a lot of data. Different types for various different purposes. I have a lot of fun figuring out ways to view and use it. This class piqued my interest and I felt like it would be very relevant and develop my knowledge for the career path I've chosen. 
 
 What do you hope to learn from this course?
 
 What I am hoping to gain from this course is a broader understanding of data and the ways in which we can use it in the professional world. 
 
 What is one thing I should know about you to help you learn?
 
 I am a visual learner and I like to make sure my homework is done at least a few days before something is due or i like to get ahead on my work. I always appreciate it when the homework assignments are available ahead of time.","I am taking this course because I am currently interning for a digital marketing firm that focuses on search engine optimization.

BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,20194,2,2,"Reflect on what you learned this week and what you experienced as you worked in RStudio. Address the following points in your reflection with 2-5 sentences each:
 
 Contrast your expectations of working in R to reality
 Describe the challenges to making the two visualizations this week: a personal timeline and a news graphic
 Explain what strategies you used to overcome these challenges.
 What aspects of the High Impact Practices project interest you (be specific about what aspects and why they interest you)? 
 In your opinion, what do you define as success for yourself and your peers as students at UW-Bothell?","Contrast your expectations of working in R to reality: I am very slowly understand R. I am still not sure what it's purpose is as far as data visualization goes but i am excited to be learning something completely new. it's a great program and helps you figure out the code in a very tangible way, although I can't imagine myself doing anything advanced on it. 
 Describe the challenges to making the two visualizations this week: a personal timeline and a news graphic. I found these exercises to be fun. i had a really hard time with the news article, mainly because i was not sure about the expectation of the assignment. my personal timeline was very simple and it certainly does not capture my life in any meaningful way. 
 Explain what strategies you used to overcome these challenges: there was no strategy really, i just ""went for it"" for lack of a better saying. I enjoyed being challenged in a different way. I have never taken a class like this so everything is pretty new. 
 What aspects of the High Impact Practices project interest you (be specific about what aspects and why they interest you)? At this point there is not much that i know about it. I think it's awesome that they are collecting data and are motivated to help students succeed. in my experience i have always felt like UW bothell truly wants me to succeed as an individual and provides resources to ensure that that happens should i choose to use them. I'd be interested to see the data around transfer students and their success after school or if the internship programs available really help students get into their preferred field.
 In your opinion, what do you define as success for yourself and your peers as students at UW-Bothell? success to me is graduating and being able to get into the work force and beginning a career that is worth my time and money spent on college. As in, i am able to plan for the future and pay my bills.","I am very slowly understand R.

 What are two things you are learning that come easily and why do you feel that way (3-5 sentences)?
 What are two things you are learning that you find challenging and why do you feel that way (3-5 sentences)?
 What are two things you are learning that you want to work on (2-4 sentences)?","1. This is a bit abstract. But your presentation and explanation of how to find correct answers as a coder really opened up my eyes. I am finding it easier to find the answer to a question that I am having in R studio. When I first started doing the assignments I was overwhelmed because of the some what clinical set up of the system, but after I took time to google explanations for the average person I found it much easier to understand what was going on. Now, when I do the assignments, I do not feel immediately stressed when I cannot figure out the code or the ""correct answer"". so in summary 1) finding answers to questions. 2)navigating the setup of the system
 
 2. In the same vein, I am finding it hard to code. I feel as though I need to google everything and that it's not as intuitive as I'd like it to be. With that being said, I believe this ties into my answer for number one. As time goes on I am having an easier time understanding what I am looking at. Another thing I am finding difficult to understand is the different types of data, you laid it out very well in class and I started to grasp it. but I do not think that I could look at a set of data and immediately know what type of data I am looking at (ordinal, nominal, etc...).
 
 3. I guess to wrap this all together in one package, I am learning how to code in Rstudio and I am learning about the different types of data and their paired visualization. These are the things I would like to keep working on as they are a big part of what the rest of the quarter is going to look like as I work on my ground research project and with giant sets of data.","1.

 I believe my role in our group has been to keep everyone on track to the best of my ability. I have also facilitated in breaking up the work evenly as well as ideation for what we should do for a research project. 
 How is writing a research question different from other writing you have done for school? (3‚Äì5 sentences)
 Writing a research question is way different than regular writing. In a sense the hardest part is coming up with the research question. We have a lot of guidance and structure as to how we should format our papers but are given freedom as to what we decide to research. once you have the question, our writing is a little but more scientific around a hypothesis than a regular writing assignment. 
 What concepts, ideas, or techniques that were initially difficult are now coming easily? (2‚Äì3 sentences)
 Honestly, i don't think that any of it has some super easy. The hardest part for me was coming up with the research question. It was challenging to focus on specific points different opinions. it's also hard looking at data and narrowing down what you should be looking at. Once you've found your data it's hard to format what exactly you need from it. so overall this had been fun but very challenging and new. 
 What concepts, ideas, or techniques are you still feeling confused about? (2‚Äì3 sentences)
 I have a hard time coding in R. I feel like once i get rolling with it though it will be a bit easier for me. As in, once i start to mess around with the data and the visualizations i will get the hang of it. i hope ha!
 What do you plan to do to address any confusion? (2‚Äì3 sentences)
 If i do not catch on, i will make a point to go to office hours or the virtual office hours. i will also coordinate with my team and see if they can help me out at all. i am sure one of us ladies can figure it out, we're smart :)","I believe my role in our group has been to keep everyone on track to the best of my ability.

BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,20194,2,5,"Prompt
 We are approaching the half-way point of the quarter, which means it is a good time to reflect on what we are learning. Below I have listed the learning objectives for the course. From this list, pick out all the objectives you have worked on. Once you choose the objectives you worked on, mention the activities you did to learn such as homework, major group assignment, group presentation, journal, out-of-class work or other activities. 
 
 The purpose of this journal is two-fold:
 
  I want you to document your learning, which we will do fully for the final portfolio.
 I want to know how effective I am as an instructor to help you reach these course goals.So if you don't include an objective, I'll assume we either haven't covered it or I need to teach it better.
 Learning objectives
 By the end of the course, students will be able to:
 
 Categorize features of effective visual representations
 Identify the different types of data and their constraints
 Relate different types of data to appropriate visualizations
 Manipulate, organize, and clean the data using simple algorithms
 Apply best practices for data management and formatting
 Report descriptive statistics
 Make an interactive data visualization for a web-page
 Author a report with data and visuals that addresses a research question
 Provide a constructive critique of a data visualization
 Be familiar with the ethical issues and power surrounding data
 Clarify responsible conduct for authoring documents with integrity
 Work effectively as a group to collaborate and share leadership throughout different stages of a project
 Contrast visualizations with other forms of communications","Categorize features of effective visual representations
  the first day of class we did an assignment where everyone had certain data given to them to research and as a class, we filled out a table of the different aspect, which has proven to be very helpful
 Identify the different types of data and their constraints
 we looked at the data that was provided and had to decide which would be applicable to our research question
 Relate different types of data to appropriate visualizations
 each group had to do a presentation of different types of data, this gave everyone a well rounded idea of each type of visualization.","the first day of class we did an assignment where everyone had certain data given to them to research and as a class, we filled out a table of the different aspect, which has proven to be very helpful

BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,20194,2,6,"Learning R can sometimes lead you to explore unexpected things. It is okay to play with the program and the code. In this journal, I want you to talk about a time that you explored in R. If you haven't played with R, take some time to do that and reflect on what happened.
 
 Describe playing with the R code and what you learned (5-7 sentences).","If i am being completely honest I really do not enjoy coding in R studio. each time that i have poked around I have been very confused and lost. aside from the HW assignments that were guided almost 100%. I do not think that i am a coder. I have taken Java, HTML and CSS and disliked it all. that being said, i do see the importance of it especially in the industry i currently work in. So i will continue to try and figure it out. there is a lot of satisfaction with creating a visual, so that in itself is motivation for me.","If i am being completely honest I really do not enjoy coding in R studio. each time that i have poked around I have been very confused and lost. aside from the HW assignments that were guided almost 100%.

BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,20194,2,7,"For this journal I would you like you to reflect on our guest speaker's presentation. This is an open journal entry that you can reflect however you would like. Below are some questions you may choose to help you reflect:
 
  What parts of Etiowo's story do you identify with?
 Who benefits from having a data analysts in healthcare?
 How does a career in data visualization align with your goals?
 What remaining question do you have about a career in data science?
 Why is a data visualization career not appealing to many people?
 If you were not able to attend the speaker's presentation, find a person who does data visualization and read about their background or career from online sources. Reflect on that person's work and what parts you can or cannot relate to.","I really enjoyed Etiowo's presentation. I think he did a really great job in describing the evolution of his career pre and post-college. It really helped put things into perspective as an upcoming graduate. I really enjoyed how he talked about everything needing data analysts and to choose a type of business that you are passionate about. I feel like students needed to hear that with the uncertainty of being out of college and into the real world. Data visualization aligns with my career goals in the sense that it will be useful in almost any sense. I work in Search Engine Optimization and we are constantly finding ways to creatively and clearly tell a story to the client how we are seeing the data, or what we believe is relevant to the client about the data we collect. I think it could not be appealing to people because coding is intimidating, especially if you don't catch on right away. But as soon as you apply your knowledge to something you are passionate about you can learn so much faster and easier. all in all i think it was awesome to bring him in, he was a great speaker and helped A LOT with different aspects of our project. he even helped us look at the code differently and explained it to us so we understood exactly what we were doing and why. two thumbs up","I really enjoyed Etiowo's presentation.

I was curious how i could apply it to my job, or any future jobs i might want to pursue. Now that i have taken it and i've learned GGPLOT i feel it's extremely relevant to many industries. I've had fun trying to figure out the best way to present data and i know that it will be fun ot use these new skills to other data. Now i feel like i look at visualizations that i see all over the place with a new lense.","When i first started in data visualization i was curious how the quarter would look.

BIS232,Intro to Data Visualization,20194,2,9,"""Without data, you are just another person with an opinion."" - Dr. (Links to an external site.)Robin Angotti, UWB
 
 Hopefully through this course you see that data is all around and power can come from being able to organize data to gain information and insights. However, as a means for communicating to an audience, visualized data mostly benefit the people who know how to interpret the graphics; many people have not developed a visual literacy to understand the figures we have made. For this journal entry, I want you to reflect on data visualizations as a means for communication.
 
 Is there a paradox to data visualization? Why are photos like those in the documentary Chasing Ice (Links to an external site.) more impactful to a broad audience than any data graph? Why are people, who want to see evidence of a claim, easily misled by data visualizations? Why do media companies often use data graphics to get our attention rather than accurately represent information?
 
 In 5-7 sentences, what function should data visualization serve for communication?","In my opinion, I think that data should serve the purpose of concrete, clear evidence to a claim. Much like the quote by Angotti referenced above, data serves as an avenue of communication between you and your audience and your claims. I think that data visualization can act as a catalyst for any argument or conversation you are trying to have with someone. It can show many different things, it can show one's point, it can show discrepancies, it can show areas in which a company is doing very well. There is a wide variety of ways that data visualizations can be used. But in simple terms, it can act as a form of communication between people about any number of things. I believe visualizations can and do play a major roll in the way that we see the information around us, it keeps people engaged and it is a very clear form of displaying information.","In my opinion, I think that data should serve the purpose of concrete, clear evidence to a claim.
