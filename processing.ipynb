    "allWords = \"As an environmental studies major, I need to work with tons of data collected on environmental issues and be able to thoroughly communicate the results to an audience. I feel this class will provide me the skills to be able to accurately analyze large pieces of data and be able to produce results that simplify what the data concludes on a certain environmental issue.       I hope to gain the ability to make sense of copious amounts of data and sense patterns that can be reported.      I feel that lecture style teachings tied with a portion of class time designated to individual work is my best way of learning a topic. Sitting through hour long lectures with no time to work through the material leaves me frustrated and unable to produce my best work. As an environmental studies major, I've seen the use of sampling, variables, and types of measurements used in my other courses, especially my science courses. The ability to properly understand the use of these statistic terms and processes will assist me in my future career. I want to help solve some of the world's environmental issues and with that comes a lot of research and science. With that research being conducted, they use statistics to make future estimates on how environmental issues such as global temperature rise will effect our planet in future years. this research will then be presented to activist, educators, and policy makers to continue the fight for environmental protection. Learning statistics and how to apply concepts of measurements will help me in my future academic career work endeavors. I feel that so far this entire course has been coming easily to me. I believe this is due to the fact that I did take a statistics course my junior year of high school and as I learn new material in the course. Because of the prior learning, I feel I haven't had a topic in previous weeks that had truly stumped me.      Currently, I am having trouble grasping the difference between measurement scales, specifically interval and ratio. I feel its because while doing the readings, I felt it wasn't covered in a way that a visual learner could grasp. I feel if given more problems that expands on the differences between the levels of measurement, I will be able to understand better. I also feel that I am having trouble with percentiles however once we go over it in class I have no doubt that I will understand.      I think in this course I would want to work on summation notation and percentiles. They are the most recent thing we covered and I feel some extra practice will solidify my knowledge on the matter. While we have not finished the assignment yet, we were able to complete a large portion of the project fairly well with one another. There were times where one of us got stuck, and it was nice to have a group who was able to help one another grasp concepts. It was also nice having group members who were able to understand the software help assist one another on creating pivot tables and charts. Working together allowed us to be able to understand new concepts such as mean, median, and mode, and how they explain the center of distribution. I thank my group mates for helping me create a lab report that explains the statistics surrounding the titanic disaster and its passengers.      During this project, one of the largest constraints we faced was time. This was our first experience with this material, and we feared we were unable to finish by the original due date. Another issue we faced was that this was many of our first experiences truly using Microsoft excel, so many of the software's tools were unusual and took a while to grasp. Lastly, an issue we faced was our ability to create a written description that described our data results. We were able to tie result patterns after finding all the data and using Excel's pivot table to find trends that we were able to describe in the report. 1. I really enjoy having readings done before class. that way I am able to read the material and come in with any questions of clarification I might need in the lecture. I also am able to interact with the material so I'm less likely to get stuck during our limited class time.       2. I would really enjoy having more practice problems with the material. While the book provides some, I would feel more comfortable with the equations if I were to work through them.       3. I have been really struck by the concepts surrounding inferential statistics. As a climate change activist we look at previous data showing climate change and using it to infer what damage our future could hold. Inferential statistics provides us the ability to make predictions and set goals to prevent the consequences we may reap if action is not conducted.       4. When using statistics to make predictions, how can we test our confidence in the data we collected? what is the best way to reduce bias when sampling? When I was younger my dad used to buy scratch lottery tickets at the grocery store, and sometimes he would win small cash prizes from the tickets. Even though winning the lottery is slim, my dad was able to win multiple times. This is possible because so many people play the lottery that the probability of my dad winning becomes more likely. A large number of trials allow for rare events, like winning the lottery, to still occur and be more expected to occur. I am a short woman, standing proudly at 5'1 and 3/4. When I compare myself to a normal distribution of women my age, I see that I am a height that lies on the lower end of the spectrum. Women's height is a normal distribution with a peak near 5'5 and symmetrical tails at the ends of the curve. Using the distribution, I can determine how my height compares to the heights of other women. 1. Finding statistics in poker was actually something that was fairly easy for my group because many have studied the math behind the game.       2. I really struggled using the vocabulary that statisticians use in our presentation. deciphering probability from chance and using percentages and ratios were hard to verbalize.       3. I really want to work on being able to present data that use statistic language so that I am able to properly discuss any piece of data with confidence. In this course, I quickly realized that the time I spent taking notes on the readings was crucial in my progress. I usually have trouble with course readings and I was able to overcome that by adapting my note-taking to a style that allowed me to absorb the information and implement it in the following class. As the course went on, I am able to go back to these notes and make connections to all the statistical concepts and visualize how they intermingle. I am taking this course because I am currently interning for a digital marketing firm that focuses on search engine optimization. Within this internship I have been exposed to a lot of data. Different types for various different purposes. I have a lot of fun figuring out ways to view and use it. This class piqued my interest and I felt like it would be very relevant and develop my knowledge for the career path I've chosen.       What I am hoping to gain from this course is a broader understanding of data and the ways in which we can use it in the professional world.       I am a visual learner and I like to make sure my homework is done at least a few days before something is due or i like to get ahead on my work. I always appreciate it when the homework assignments are available ahead of time. I am very slowly understand R. I am still not sure what it's purpose is as far as data visualization goes but i am excited to be learning something completely new. it's a great program and helps you figure out the code in a very tangible way, although I can't imagine myself doing anything advanced on it.    Describe the challenges to making the two visualizations this week: a personal timeline and a news graphic. I found these exercises to be fun. i had a really hard time with the news article, mainly because i was not sure about the expectation of the assignment. my personal timeline was very simple and it certainly does not capture my life in any meaningful way.   there was no strategy really, i just went for it for lack of a better saying. I enjoyed being challenged in a different way. I have never taken a class like this so everything is pretty new.    What aspects of the High Impact Practices project interest you (be specific about what aspects and why they interest you)? At this point there is not much that i know about it. I think it's awesome that they are collecting data and are motivated to help students succeed. in my experience i have always felt like UW bothell truly wants me to succeed as an individual and provides resources to ensure that that happens should i choose to use them. I'd be interested to see the data around transfer students and their success after school or if the internship programs available really help students get into their preferred field.  success to me is graduating and being able to get into the work force and beginning a career that is worth my time and money spent on college. As in, i am able to plan for the future and pay my bills. 1. This is a bit abstract. But your presentation and explanation of how to find correct answers as a coder really opened up my eyes. I am finding it easier to find the answer to a question that I am having in R studio. When I first started doing the assignments I was overwhelmed because of the some what clinical set up of the system, but after I took time to google explanations for the average person I found it much easier to understand what was going on. Now, when I do the assignments, I do not feel immediately stressed when I cannot figure out the code or the correct answer. so in summary 1) finding answers to questions. 2)navigating the setup of the system      2. In the same vein, I am finding it hard to code. I feel as though I need to google everything and that it's not as intuitive as I'd like it to be. With that being said, I believe this ties into my answer for number one. As time goes on I am having an easier time understanding what I am looking at. Another thing I am finding difficult to understand is the different types of data, you laid it out very well in class and I started to grasp it. but I do not think that I could look at a set of data and immediately know what type of data I am looking at (ordinal, nominal, etc...).      3. I guess to wrap this all together in one package, I am learning how to code in Rstudio and I am learning about the different types of data and their paired visualization. These are the things I would like to keep working on as they are a big part of what the rest of the quarter is going to look like as I work on my ground research project and with giant sets of data. I believe my role in our group has been to keep everyone on track to the best of my ability. I have also facilitated in breaking up the work evenly as well as ideation for what we should do for a research project.       Writing a research question is way different than regular writing. In a sense the hardest part is coming up with the research question. We have a lot of guidance and structure as to how we should format our papers but are given freedom as to what we decide to research. once you have the question, our writing is a little but more scientific around a hypothesis than a regular writing assignment.       Honestly, i don't think that any of it has some super easy. The hardest part for me was coming up with the research question. It was challenging to focus on specific points different opinions. it's also hard looking at data and narrowing down what you should be looking at. Once you've found your data it's hard to format what exactly you need from it. so overall this had been fun but very challenging and new.       I have a hard time coding in R. I feel like once i get rolling with it though it will be a bit easier for me. As in, once i start to mess around with the data and the visualizations i will get the hang of it. i hope ha!      If i do not catch on, i will make a point to go to office hours or the virtual office hours. i will also coordinate with my team and see if they can help me out at all. i am sure one of us ladies can figure it out, we're smart :) the first day of class we did an assignment where everyone had certain data given to them to research and as a class, we filled out a table of the different aspect, which has proven to be very helpful   we looked at the data that was provided and had to decide which would be applicable to our research question   each group had to do a presentation of different types of data, this gave everyone a well rounded idea of each type of visualization. If i am being completely honest I really do not enjoy coding in R studio. each time that i have poked around I have been very confused and lost. aside from the HW assignments that were guided almost 100%. I do not think that i am a coder. I have taken Java, HTML and CSS and disliked it all. that being said, i do see the importance of it especially in the industry i currently work in. So i will continue to try and figure it out. there is a lot of satisfaction with creating a visual, so that in itself is motivation for me. I really enjoyed Etiowo's presentation. I think he did a really great job in describing the evolution of his career pre and post-college. It really helped put things into perspective as an upcoming graduate. I really enjoyed how he talked about everything needing data analysts and to choose a type of business that you are passionate about. I feel like students needed to hear that with the uncertainty of being out of college and into the real world. Data visualization aligns with my career goals in the sense that it will be useful in almost any sense. I work in Search Engine Optimization and we are constantly finding ways to creatively and clearly tell a story to the client how we are seeing the data, or what we believe is relevant to the client about the data we collect. I think it could not be appealing to people because coding is intimidating, especially if you don't catch on right away. But as soon as you apply your knowledge to something you are passionate about you can learn so much faster and easier. all in all i think it was awesome to bring him in, he was a great speaker and helped A LOT with different aspects of our project. he even helped us look at the code differently and explained it to us so we understood exactly what we were doing and why. two thumbs up When i first started in data visualization i was curious how the quarter would look. I was curious how i could apply it to my job, or any future jobs i might want to pursue. Now that i have taken it and i've learned GGPLOT i feel it's extremely relevant to many industries. I've had fun trying to figure out the best way to present data and i know that it will be fun ot use these new skills to other data. Now i feel like i look at visualizations that i see all over the place with a new lense. In my opinion, I think that data should serve the purpose of concrete, clear evidence to a claim. Much like the quote by Angotti referenced above, data serves as an avenue of communication between you and your audience and your claims. I think that data visualization can act as a catalyst for any argument or conversation you are trying to have with someone. It can show many different things, it can show one's point, it can show discrepancies, it can show areas in which a company is doing very well. There is a wide variety of ways that data visualizations can be used. But in simple terms, it can act as a form of communication between people about any number of things. I believe visualizations can and do play a major roll in the way that we see the information around us, it keeps people engaged and it is a very clear form of displaying information. While taking Business Statistics as a freshman our professor introduced us to infographics and how visually we can misconstrue data to market an idea or argue a point. It reminded me of the fake news debate that was brought into attention around the time of the 2016 election. In our era of advanced technology, there is a power structure that has grown: of those who know how to create and bend the data at their will, and those who still blindly believe that everything presented in a graph in 100% factual. Although I may not be a Mathematical Thinking & Visualization major, as a Community Psych major we also deal with a lot of data, and whether we can accurately portray and communicate the information we gather effectively has the potential for harm on larger social scales. I want to be an honest scientist, and I know in order to do that, it's good to know various ways of communicating with others. Also in high school, one of my friends knew Tableau and she could make really pretty graphs from data I collected for her for our robotics team, so of course, now I want to know how to do that. hahaha      Like I said prior, I'd like to know the behind the scenes of how a collection of data becomes a visual that is then presented to the public and how people interpret the data based on the presentation. The psychology of visualization in a way. I've only heard of people using Tableau or Excel for graphs prior to you mentioning R in the syllabus, so I'm looking forward and I'm curious to see how that program works. From how you explained the adaptability and development of how people use R, I was reminded of Github, which I recall is what users use to share and collaborate on code/mods/projects for various programming languages such as Javascript, C++, and Arduino for the raspberry pi.       I can't really think of anything specifically at the moment. I'm pretty good at adapting to whatever the classroom structure is. I don't really shy away from asking questions either so I don't think you have anything to worry about. If something does come to mind, I'll probably email you or go to office hours. Oh oh, when it comes to group work, if I have issues with working with my groupmates, I struggle in asking professors for help, but I've been working on that. Hopefully things go smoothly, I'm not too worried about anything. I'm just excited to learn, this is all new content for me~! :D I think I mentioned in a prior journal that my understanding of programs related to data visualization was primarily Exell and Tableau. I expected the interface to look pretty similar to Tableau, with graphs being on the screen and the 'codes' being used were to specify the data sets included in those graphs.    The appearance StudioR reminds me more of how JavaScript while the actual 'coding' bit looks very similar to Python. (Which I appreciate since I've tried Python long ago, but it also worries me cause I recall it being harder to keep track of the code as we jumped into more complicated territory.)    I still don't see how visualization will work with the program so it's been harder for me to really register the technical data. I'm more of a visual and patterns oriented person so this straight forward 'logic' stuff is hard for me to follow.   a personal timeline and a news graphic   With the news graphic, it was hard to be more specific with the data in the graphs because there was only so much information available. We consider doing more of a mathematical breakdown of the import prices of Avacados and Grapes per year based on what little we had but opted against it for the simple pie graph we could make from the customer base percentage.   For the personal timeline, it looked like everyone did a very different format for how they approached graphing their life.   The circles made us think of the Avacado seeds and the shape of graphs so we incorporated that cute imagery for the pie graphs which we ended up really liking.    I know I started with a general timeline, but I liked how Germaine rated the quality of her experiences through a more expressive line graph so I implemented that for myself as well.    When she brought up some of the stats of how many people get to engage in High Impact Practices, I was curious as to perhaps how many working students participated in this pole.    Many of the students here do work partime or fulltime jobs alongside school and the structure of UWBs classroom schedules and the low-pressure small environment for the most part really helps students have the ability to do that, but sometimes at the cost of participating in these campus spaces.    I know for me I've felt like I was behind as a student because my sophomore year I didn't get to participate in much research or clubs, or anything of that sort because I had to go to school outside of school to get certified to help my parents with their business and I'm sure the working student population gets lost sometimes when we think about student engagement and how we want to raise those numbers.    I think the student body here at UWB is too diverse for there to be a set standard of success and I think the typical checklist of what it means to be a good student or to have a great university life doesn't really apply to us in the same way because we are primarily a commuter school.    Since many of us live at home, we still feel the ties of familial expectations that we bring with us onto campus and we explore challenging those narratives here rather than in the freedom you may get with being able to live in a dorm and away from the life that you lived.   We get to restart as many students do, but from my experience, I had to more intimately address my past and the person I want to grow into being because I'm still to close to home (physically and figuratively).    I, therefore, see success to be more cultivated by our own standards because we directly have to address where we come from every day with where we are going. I feel fortunate that many of the classes I get to participate in focus more on my own personal development over my academic scoring so that I have this space to explore ideas in a more fluid way without that much stress. I'm more of a qualitative data person, so making connections of ideas comes more naturally to me. I had some experience with coding in Python and collecting data to be used for Tableau graphs in highschool as a scouting data analyst for my robotics team so I'm familiar with the ideas and some of the graphs that we'll be presenting next week.       Like I said prior, I'm not quite a technical person, but when it comes to numbers I do actually find data really interesting because I know there is more value to the number beyond its numerical component. I do struggle with making the connections between the visuals and the code and I get really caught up in the details regarding the code. It just doesn't register in my brain. So when going through the textbook exercise and seeing the actual graph pop up I almost jumped out of my seat cause it was so exciting. I could see how everything relates more, which I struggled with in using swirl.       I really want to get the coding portion down because I know I struggle with it. I borrowed some books from the public library regarding the purpose and uses of stats to increase my overall interest, but I know actually going through the excises and practicing things more will probably help bring my mind away from all the errors I keep making. When R was first introduced my table mates thought I would drop that class cause the idea of coding sounds like a nightmare to me (I tried CS related stuff in high school and just feel so defeated by not being able to comprehend it). I do find the value of visualization though and I think it's something I'd like to see more in the social sciences. I hate reading academic articles that include tables because I've never understood how to read them, but I never really had issues understanding graphs and diagrams. Might as well mix the best of both worlds, powerful qualitative and quantitative analysis. We divided the work evenly into sections. Before beginning though, we explored the question as a group to ensure we were approaching everything from the same place.       What made coming up with the research question complicated was already having variables we could choose from. We essentially kept going back and forth between being specific and broad based on the data we believed to have. Usually, when exploring a research question, I'm used to starting broad and perhaps going in completely different directions when further exploring the specifics. Through literature, as an undergrad, we're limited on how far we can go to answer our questions but with data, it feels kinda like a maze. We have the limitations present already but we don't have the perspective to see where they would be. So it's hard to figure out when you would stop.       I did not understand swirl at all. I kept getting stuck and felt really dumb when I found out the answers I was looking for were actually really simple (4 &9) and I just kept complicating the code. I'm a visual person, so actually seeing the visuals instead of the tables of data changes everything for me. Like I think I said last week, being able to see the graphs appear in RStudio helps everything make sense.       I can't think of the specifics, but I do still worry about the coding. In the practices, I could type everything but I still don't think I understand what each aspect is supposed to be. I didn't understand the difference between a vector, matrix, and array until I google-imaged a picture of them. The code doesn't clearly show that difference, it's implied and I get lost in the in-between. I think primarily I don't know what I don't know. I find myself struggling to ask for help when I don't even know where I'm stuck.       I tried typing out notes, but I think I'm gonna opt for written notes in this class. I ironically need to create more visuals for myself to pick up the material. I think when we first were getting into ggplots it was exciting cause we could finally see that the code is capable of making graphs, but now I think I'm stuck with the actual coding. I know 'logic' formulas are supposed to be straight forward but I've never really understood how communicating with computers works. It's so simple it should be easy, but my brain relies on making patterns, and if I can't see how things relate in my mind then I'll overcomplicate things to create some sort of foundation for myself.       In high school, I recall giving up on CS because something that seemed so easy and straightforward to everyone around me didn't make sense to me, and it makes me feel kinda stupid. Is this like learned helplessness? When you genuinely believe you can't do something so you don't and then are unable to do it? That's kinda scary.       I know data visualization is important and I want to learn how to do it because I don't understand just charts of data (like that weird ugly format they use to present the data from surveys that measure things like happiness, burnout, etc. - I don't understand the numbers, show me an image to explain the same idea in relation to everything else).       I guess this open-work in class format is kinda hard for me cause when I'm learning something completely new, I feel really lost and overwhelmed (especially anything related to math/logic-based thinking). I don't know how to ask for help because I feel stupid just saying I need help. but not being able to convey where I need help specifically. I don't know/understand enough to convey where I'm lost or what I need.       I do recognize that I'm more pattern-oriented. I like working with qualitative data because it's easier for me to relate ideas together because I can read into them more. I'm also a visual person (hence why I wanted to take this class), little visuals/infographics/pictures/stories/scenarios help me better remember concepts because I can relate them to things I already know. It's like putting together books on a shelf based on how the content of the books relate to each other vs. putting them in order by color,title, author name, or publication code.       I liked it when you would have your screen up on the projector and we could follow along step by step on how you were doing things. It was kinda hard to keep up with everything since you were going really fast (which makes sense cause we only have so much time).       Oh, I wanted to ask you if there are other resources you would recommend using to help better understand r (like video tutorials, podcasts, or infographics).       Addressed:      In-progress report with groups: data summary & research question      Correlation Presentation: established agenda and worked independently, presented as a collective   Addressed but foggy:       Types of Graphs Presentations: I need to take notes from the powerpoints to recall    Certain groups engaged the audience more than others (memorable = content retained)     Measurement of Data Worksheet: Nominal, Ordinal, Ratio, Interval    Can easily look to the worksheet as a reference      1st Week - creating visuals to go along quantitative data in articles (drew avocados and grapes with pie charts inside)       Not sure if the data summary counts - I don't think we understand how this is supposed to work (format of presenting qualitative(?) data?)     Brief presentation on representation - who is included in the data and what is being said about them    Representation Reading & Journal Response   Haven't done:    I mean we're kinda learning the basics with R for Data Science but it's not really registering for me. I think I reflected more on my experience using R more in my last journal entry so I apologize if things seem sort of repetitive here. I'll try to keep things brief. I believe the most unexpected things I've found through exploring R were the different types of acronyms used to represent the different types of statistical tests. From working on the analytical approaches, I recall initially as a group we were looking for the Linear Mixed Effect (LME) thinking it was the test we were going to use. By typing up what we thought the acronym would be based on, from what we learned from you (which I learned I made a mistake in what I wrote down), other acronyms, such as GLM (general linear models) popped up. We later found out that the proper test we were looking for was along those lines, so through little mistakes and messing around with anything we thought could work we ended up in the right direction. I think. I dunno. I'm still not really getting R, but apparently that was the case. As Etiowo explained in his presentation, through creating a database of information essentially, doctors can rely on that information to save time in their diagnosis. Being able to find trends in a patient's experience in comparison to others can be crucial in terms of when to address a stage in someone's condition. This gap in time is essential as a condition can be addressed too late, too early, not addressed at all, or addressed when not necessary. Improving the accuracy of these predictions can help instill better patient to doctor trust and improve hospital reputation overall. Doctors benefit because they can better direct their staff and communicate to patients and patients benefit through receiving appropriate care.       I actually went to an Industrial-Organizational (IO) Psychology connect event at Seattle Pacific University last night and I had a lengthy conversation with a PhD student about R. The event was essentially one of those student interest nights where we could talk with students in the masters and PhD programs, sample one of their classes, and question professors about the work they do. IO Psychologists essentially do an analysis of businesses to better improve organizational practices and employee engagement to maintain employee retention. It's a fairly new, but fast-growing field because of the high demand for company reconstruction.       IO Psychologists are usually called in as consultants to either create assessments or analyze from existing data to help make changes in a company. Data visualization is crucial as it serves as a means to better communicate the impact the data analysis may have for organizations. From what I've noticed is, most business practices have been summarized into simplified charts or visuals. It could possibly be used for the sake of efficiency as retaining information from a quick image is faster than memorizing a paragraph of information.       From what the PhD student told me, many companies are interested in hiring analysts who are familiar with R vs. SPSS because R is free and is flexible enough to be applied in many ways. She urged me to keep up with learning it because of how useful it is and I felt more inspired to keep going with it after talking with her.       I look forward to learning more with you. :)       What remaining question do you have about a career in data science?      What are the nuances between different skills? Like, are there specific jobs that require a skill level and how does pay vary depending on the skills you have?       Why is a data visualization career not appealing to many people?      I think, while crucial considering the mass amounts of unanalyzed data floating around and being held, people may not be interested in data visualization because of the grunt work required to get to that point. Making the pretty graphs seems easier than collecting the data, cleaning it, and then analyzing it. I remember when doing scouting in robotics in high school, I did the grunt work of manually inserting data into excel sheets after every match (you get sick of seeing 0s and 1s after a while), checking for issues in the data, and then handing over the clean set to our analyst so she could make the visualization and then someone else would present our data to other teams. No one wants to do that work. I remember staying up late some nights by myself rushing to get that data done just so someone could make a pretty picture of them and then people forgetting that there was more to the work that just the graphs at the end. I remember being turned off to this kind of work for a while because of how unrecognized it was and how time-consuming it is (I got sick often during competition season). But at the end of the day, seeing where the information goes and seeing how it helped people make decisions is what made it worth it. Although I was somewhat familiar with data visualization prior, I was limited in my understanding and thought that more nuanced visualizations primarily occurred within Tableau. From how we used data on my high school robotics team, I just assumed we needed to include as much information as possible to further argue the relevance of the data. I didn't expect the opposite to be the case and practically essential for clear and precise communication. It's been interesting learning more about the reasoning behind why certain graphs are better at communicating certain information better than others and the practicality of design beyond aesthetics. I never really liked how numeric presentations of information were presented as naturally opposing to more artistic visual presentations, so it's cool that data visualization is like a lovechild of those ideas. It's like another way of interdisciplinary practices existing together, of statistics and design. It's really cool. Gosh, it's so cool... Variety in visual communication is crucial as it can address not on a wider audience, but individually reach out to the hearts of each. In the case of Chasing Ice, having visual documentation of the glaciers is able to reach a larger audience from a variety of cultures and ages because it presents life to us. There is no significant prior knowledge really needed for someone to understand the changes over time and the impact is long term. When people think of winter, penguins, or climate change they probably picture the ice caps in relation to either seeing these photos or hearing them brought up in conversation. In contrast, data graphs are good for presenting factual information that can be taken in quickly to be then utilized.      In regards to the long term, for the most part, data visualizations aren't memorable enough on their own to be easily called out again from memory and the simplicity causes it to lose emotional depth because of how direct it is. Because of its efficient design, data visualization can be easily misused to shut down others on the basis of factual claims or used in persuasion taking it beyond being a tool for communication to being used as evidence in arguments. The purpose of the tool becomes lost, giving power to those who know how to utilize it, who may also utilize it to take power away from others.       Instead of being a weapon, data visualization should be used to connect people together under a mutual understanding of the patterns of our world so that we can move forward in growth. Just as the arts can be used to express the depths of human emotions, data visualization has the potential to be used to express the depth of human thought, to aid intellectual exploration. This is the purpose of our tools, to aid us towards each other and the future, not tear us apart. Being completely honest here, I signed up for this course on accident. I'm majoring in Computer Science and Software Engineering and I need to take a statistics class to fulfill one of the requirements. In June, I was looking for a statistics class and this class showed up on the list so I just decided to do it. I learned this week that this is actually the only class on the list I was given that doesn't fulfill my stats credit. That is how I got into this course, now to talk about why I'm taking this course. I realized after reading the syllabus and going to talk to Professor Hollingsworth, she's the QSC manager and my previous math professor, that this class actually has a ton of great skills and information I can learn which can actually be used in real life.      In this day and age where there is tons of data out in the world, it's time we adapt and learn how to use it properly. I'm hoping to learn more about how data can be used, what it can tell me about the world and how it's applicable to me, or at least why I should care about it.      I'm very nervous when speaking in front of people, and I'm extremely shy especially in a class when I don't know anyone. I'm really excited to take this class though!!! I'm learning to code in Java and I'm finding it a bit tough cause we are going through it really fast. I've done a bit of C++ but that was really easy just because the teaching style was a bit easier than what I'm doing now with Java. When I though about ;earning R, I was expecting it to be what I;m going through with Java. I was really dreading it, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I like that fact that I an go at my own pace. I really like working on swirl, it's easier than working with an actual person. I also find R much easier than Java, but maybe that's because I'm not really advanced in either.      Making a personal timeline wasn't really hard. It was a bit stressful choosing what I wanted to share with people but when making it, I just stuck to the basics. I did it by year and did major things in my life. I really didn't think of it as  data visualization. The news graphic was really hard, but that's just because I was over thinking it. I was thinking of the typical graphs to portray my date but I realized that limited what I could actually do after you came to talk to Samuel and I.      To overcome the challenges I talked about above I would say taking to others helps. Most of my challenges came when I started over thinking and over analyzing the situation. In reality the solution to my challenges is pretty simple. Talking out the problem and letting someone shed light on the situation helped.      I'm really interested on the study abroad, internships and research aspects. I feel like I kind of assumed those would be there because I feel everyone wants to do one of the three but I would want to see actual proof as to how this actually contributes to a successful graduate. One I kind of am interested in is the first year programs. I',m assuming the Discovery classes we do at UWB would fall into this? I am interested in this because as someone who did the Discovery classes, I completely disagree with it. In orientation people always said we would love the DCore classes but I found them to be a waste of time. They were so random and i wish they ad more to do with actual majors. I understand they want us to discovery other aspects of university but having a DCore class about walking, or reading is completely a waste of time. We should have some about Design, because design is a major, or engineering, or something that can guide us to try different major, not different hobbies .      Personally, success at UWB for me is getting 4.0 in all my classes and getting a great job at the end of it with cool friends. I'm kind of tired of people telling me there's more to university than getting a degree when in reality the degree and the job you secure with the degree is what is going to financially sustain you to even think of doing other things. I personally don't think the things we are doing now are that easy. I would say the only thing I'm finding easy at this point is maybe using swirl and learning about different graphs. I personally don't like graphing things due to math but learning about graphs and not having to graph something is totally fine with me. I'm saying maybe to swirl because I thought it was easy but now it's getting a bit hard trying to remember all the different commands from different sections.      I'm finding it hard to pick a research question. To properly answer your question, something I'm learning is to read the excel sheet with all the data and information, and based on that, I'm finding it hard to read the excel sheet in a way that is helpful and picking a research question. It's a bit overwhelming trying to understand the excel sheets and trying to choose what to research and I feel like my brain starts yelling at me every time I look at it.       I want to work on learning my swirl codes commands better. I'm really trying to get them down but sometimes my mind blanks. I'm also trying not to take charge of my group. I realized my group mates are insanely quiet people which is fine because in most if not all the groups I'm usually in I'm usually the quiet person which I love. Now I'm in a way forcing myself to be the talkative person cause I realized if I don't, then nothing would get done. So that is something I'm learning and also want to work on because it technically is a good skill to learn for later on. I've helped with communication and research. I was able to make a group chat, and the google documents and slide presentation with all the members so we could have a platform that was accessible for everyone to communicate and contribute evenly. In terms of research for each assignment, we were able to each take a small part to do then add later to the respective document we will use to turn in.      I personally don't like writing research questions because I feel like it's too much freedom. I think it's different from other writing because in other classes we are told what to write about. When I write anything for a class there are certain questions asked that are specific enough it doesn't really require much creativity, just analysis. Writing or creating a research question requires you to look at a ton of information that really might not go well together and try and formulate a question, that you will later answer. I would really like to pick an easy research question, but it wouldn't be considered good, or well thought out. It also requires you to be a little creative and push yourself.      I think seeing how to visualize things differently is becoming a bit easier than when I started. I think I really got stuck to the graphs I was comfortable with such as line charts, bar graphs and scatter plots.       I'm finding it hard to remember all the graphs we learned about his week. I feel like a lot of the graphs overlapped each other and I'm just confused as to when to use which. I personally would go for the easiest type, but I'm learning that it's better to go for the graph that makes the information your choosing to portray seem more understandable to the reader/viewer. When I was looking for examples to use in my presentation, some graphs looked pretty but I personally couldn't understand anything which was a bit disheartening.      Hopefully, I'll find the time to research more about them, but realistically I'm hoping sometime this quarter the research we are doing will force me to try a new graphing style. Group presentation   HW 2. Number 47   HW 2. Measurement     Personal timeline   HW2. Measurement     Group presentations and assignments   Data summary   Research question     Using graphs on excel and RStudio   I don't think we've gone over a couple of key concepts but I do think that is because we haven't really don much with our research projects yet. I was a bit confused about clarifying responsible conduct for authoring documents with integrity. Would that go with any writing we do that includes citations? I don't think we've talked about it in the class but I feel that it is more of common knowledge that we shouldn't plagiarise and should give credit to the authors. Generally speaking from playing with R and using it the past week I would say R is very interesting, but overall hard for me to understand. I feel like it's very mathy. That just might be because of what we are doing with it. I get the impression that R is mainly used for making data visuals, or stats diagrams in some way. I'm guessing there are ways to do it in other languages but I'm guessing R is more for this than the general object-oriented coding stuff. I realized how different R is from other languages. By other languages, I mean Java and C++. I feel like Java and C++ are much easier to use, but that's also cause I think I learned them at a slower pace and didn't do a substantial amount of math-related things to with them unless you would call concatenating strings together math. I personally came to UWB to study computer science and software engineering. I was planning to minor in math because it was an easy add on, but I got talking to people and they said I could use that minor as a backup and become a data scientist which I never thought about. I've never thought about going into data analytics because I didn't really understand it. I really like how he chose health care and is actually doing something to help others. Something I related to was when he said that it was hard at first because he could talk really technical but you also have to be able to talk to the common person in plain English to explain things such as the process, the results. I've experienced this with CS and doing a bit of graphic design. Some people really want to rush me but it's hard for me to explain the process in a way that everyone can understand and I thought I was the only one who struggled with not being able to translate technical language.      Data analysts in health care analyze all the healthcare data available to them and are able to come to certain conclusions based on the data. One thing I remember Etiowo talking about is improving patient care and efficiency in where he has worked, and where he is starting his new job. People that go to the healthcare facility and the health care facility will benefit from having a data analyst there because they help healthcare practitioners to provide better, faster and efficient care.       I'm not really sure. I never thought about going into data visualization. I'm still not for it because I find it very confusing, especially R, I'm very lost on it and I don't think I could use it in a career on a daily basis.      Do you truly enjoy your jobs?    It's worth the time going to university? Or is it better to learn it online for half the price?   Why are you in this field?? For the money? For a guaranteed job? For pure interest?   How much of your time is spent sitting at a computer?      It's a lot of work, and I think a most people don't really know what it is. When I first heard the term I thought about graphs, sitting around and making graphs and that doesn't sound interesting to me at all. I think most people who are looking for jobs, not out of money but out of interest, want jobs that they enjoy and maybe can make a difference in. Right off the bat, hearing about the career field of data visualization doesn't seem that interesting. It sounds like something you would do to make a lot of money but never really liking it, or being overworked and never finding the salary a properly worth your time and stress. I understand why data visualization is so important. I mainly noticed this when doing research on my group discussion presentation. Before I used to kind of think it data visualization was important but now I for sure know it. This changed when learning about warming stripes. The warming stripes graphs were essentially made to be able to start conversations about global warming and climate change. I found a statistic online that said two out of three Americans want to learn more about climate change and that fewer than half of Americans think climate change will harm them personally. Through data visualization, specifically through warming stripes, this is a simple and easy way for people who want to learn about climate change and those who don't believe climate change is a real problem to actually view the stats behind it. Plus they're colour coded and who doesn't love that! And the great thing about it is that after looking at warming stripes, there are more data visuals that will go more in-depth and have information that the warming stripes didn't have. So this was my explanation to say I've realised how efficient and important data visualisation can be. Data visualization helps to quickly and clearly communicate the story that the data represents. This is done by portraying information clearly and efficiently to people through graphs, plots, pictures, tables, and charts selected. By doing this it makes complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable to the general population. Data visualization should make it easier for people despite their knowledge on the subject to understand what exactly is being portrayed. To answer the main question, the function data visualization should serve for communication is to clearly portray data in a visual form to help others understand what exactly the data is saying. It should help people understand, and digest information and hopefully start a conversation around the given dataset/topic. While this class helps to fulfill my final NW credit, I chose this course because it consists of content I'll be able to use in work and life after graduation.      I hope to better my abilities of taking out key points of data in order to create something other people can read clearly. Easy to read/get the take away in fast paced manner.      One thing I've realized helps me learn is to have an example of what's being taught in a visual form. I wasn't really sure what to expect when first downloading R, other than it looked like we were going to be coding. However, I do like the way it's set up and apply math in a way that I haven't before.      The timeline wasn't too difficult but I struggled to come up with more ideas for the news graphic. The two graphs I used are some of the most basic visualizations and I'm sure there's more that I could have done but just haven't learned or seen before.       One strategy I used for the news graphic visualization was to look up an array of other data visualizations. I did see some more complex graphs that I haven't had much personal experience with but the number/article I was working with seemed too simple to apply to those more in depth/detailed graphs.       In regards to the High Impact Practices project, I'm interested to learn more about the best way to go about gathering data and presenting it for such a big question. There's multiple variables to the question regarding what students are doing while in school to help them succeed after graduating and I'm also interested in what the results we'll find will be.       Success can be defined as a lot of things by different people. For me, personally, success is achieving my goals (big or small) to the best of my ability. If I'm putting my best self forward, I intend for it to give me the drive to get myself to where I want to be. For me that would look like getting an internship soon and having a big girl job this time next year. 1. One of the things I've learned so far that came somewhat easy were the first few lessons on R studios. I've recently piqued an in interest in the coding world and learning some of the basics wasn't too bad. Another would be the concept of cognitive artifacts and how that plays a role in data visualization. For example, I clearly understood the reference you made in class the other day about how data isn't always to scale (reference the bar graph comparison on the powerpoint).      2. One of the things I find challenging are the more complicated codes in R. Applying the math and logic skills I already know but in a new environment, on the computer. One of the other things would be creating graphs within R studios. However, that might be more or a tech question.       3. One thing I know I need to work on is remembering the measurements and what makes something a certain type of data. I'd also like to brush up on the different types of graphs there are in order to indicate which will be best for use in the group project. I've supported my groups success to touching base whenever something needs to be done. We've done well with being in contact via texting and with answering questions when they arise. Furthermore, I make myself available to answering questions if I can as well as checking in with how the others are doing.       Writing a research question is different from other papers I've written because data has to be taken into account. Rather than arguing something that might be seen as more abstract, numbers are being used to support the argument. In contrast to an English paper, for example, we also get to look at other people's work on the same concepts to make connections to the research question and argument.       Considering I haven't written a scientific research paper in a number of years, that in general was intersting to reencounter. However, after reading over the articles about research questions and creating our question I'm refreshed and more comfortable.      It's not as much confusion as wondering what type of visualization my group will use and how exactly that will look like working with R.       Discuss with my group and also ask for a refresher on inserting graphs into R because my computer crashed and the data I had previously had in there is no longer there We did this in class when we were split into groups and assigned a type of data then presented to our peers in order to fully fill out the table.   - I recall doing this when we gave our presentations all the different types of graphs. I know my group, and a lot of others, made connections to what kind of data or situation you’d use the appropriate visualization for.   - We have begun doing this with constructing a research question in our groups as well as beginning to write our data summaries.   - We’ve been doing this type of work while working in R as well as the annotation assignment.   - My group is in contact via text message to discuss anything outside of class and the past few group work assignments have been split evenly amongst us.   - I am aware that data is the most valuable thing in our modern world and the way it has played a part in ethical issues/our daily lives. Playing with R really has made me more interested in coding. While I'm not the best at math, starting at the basic levels in R is doable and actually kind of fun. Even when it does get more difficult, there's still this sense of excitement when you do something correct. Opposed to getting the error message and then R (or i guess swirl more specifically) just telling you what to do after so many failed attempts. It's also made me wonder how the R language compares to other coding languages and if learning R would transfer over into attempting to learn one of the many others. As I wasn't able to attend class on Wednesday, I turned to TED to find someone to discuss for this weeks journal. I discovered Aaron Koblin, a data artist whom has now completely interested me in the line of work that he's doing. When thinking about data visualization, I think about the visual (obviously) but also the data, which typically means numbers, as we've mostly seen throughout the quarter. Koblin started off with thinking numerically as well, becoming well known for his visualizations related to number of flights going in and out of the country at different times of the day. What I find super fascinating is how he managed to use this type of data visualization skill set and work it into music videos, becoming a creative director for the late Johnny Cash and working with bands like Arcade Fire. While watching the TedTalk and hearing about some of the work he's done, I made parallels to how it would have been created and what work I've personally done in R. Assigning certain objects to a name and the coding/programming that goes into how it all becomes the final product. When I first joined this class, I honestly didn't know what to expect. I knew there was going to be a little peek into the realm of coding but wasn't sure how it tied into data visualization. After thinking about it for a moment I realized that it meant we were coding to produce graphs with given data (duh, Selena). I thought at the beginning and still think now that this course has given important tools to move forward with. Prior to this class, the most experience I'd had was related to altering html on myspace and tumblr. I can now move forward with the tools to take a given data set and portray it in a more pleasing way, in my opinion. Data visualization in the form of graphs, like we've seen in this class, compared to images as seen in Chasing Ice can often times tell the same story, but in drastically different ways. When looking at a graph on rising sea levels, for example, it's easy to see that the line would be increasing. However, when combined with images comparing the landscape of glacial areas compared to a photo today, there's even more of a reaction. There's a physical element added that makes an audience actually seeing the changes have a long-lasting effect. Furthermore, it could also be simpler to understand two pictures with just two date/time stamps than breaking down/using the visual literacy to assess a graph. Media companies often use data graphics to get our attention rather than accurately represent information because there's usually more motive going on behind closed doors than just informing an audience. When using data graphics in media, it's also usually the goal to at lest get the audiences attention to focus on the topic, to at least plant the seed of interest of what's being discussed. Data visualization overall should serve as a way to get a story told with the data given in a way that the target audience can understand thoroughly. I took this course because it’s a core requirement for my major (MTV) but I am also interested in going into data science so I probably would have taken it as an elective any ways. I have previously taken a statistics class in which we used R, but I am hoping to refresh my skills and enhance my data cleaning abilities. I figure the skills I develop in this course will greatly contribute to the work I hope to do post-graduation. I personally prefer to work on data analysis projects alone, so I know sharing the load of the work is something that I will have to work on and which I think is good for you to know is one of my weaknesses. Since I’ve worked with R before, my expectations weren’t much different from reality. However, I haven’t worked in R in about 2 years so it was good to have a refresher on the syntax. I keep trying to use java syntax because that’s what I’ve had more recent experience using.       I didn’t find much challenge to the visualizations we made this week. I’d say the most difficult part was just thinking up ideas on how to display the news line we found in the number 47 assignment. To work through this I just envisioned advertising techniques which I’ve seen and that gave me some inspiration to work from.      The aspect of High Impact Practices that interested me was the data behind student transfers to and from UW Bothell. I personally planned on attending Central Washington University for four years but after the first two years I had changed my major to something which the University didn’t specifically have so I had to transfer to UWB. I think the fact that certain departments require you to be accepted into the major when you apply to the university in order to keep their transfer rates low is interesting. So I think the data behind these phenomenon could be interesting to work with.       I would define success as a lot of things. I think personally, attaining a degree in something that I find interesting enough to dedicate at least a large chunk of my life to, is a success. However, I know others have their own unique definitions of what makes them a success and those are valid for their personal experience. So far, the little work we have done in R and the group data visualization presentation have been the easiest assignments. Since I’ve worked with R, the intro assignments we’ve been doing in swirl have been essentially a refresher, thus have been pretty easy. As well, our group chose to present maps which I’ve taken a GIS class before so it’s again like a refresher on knowledge I already have.       I would say what has been the most challenging would be not necessarily what we’re learning, rather that in class I have been having to walk through a fellow student who gets confused very easily and I am not a very patient teacher. As well, forming a research question has been difficult because I am not entirely sure what exact area of knowledge I want to approach since there are a few available. Along with that, doing background research has been difficult because we're looking into something relatively new and very specific.       Again, it’s not something we are exclusively learning but I think I could definitely work on my teaching skills and being more patient with others since I do have prior experience with what we’re doing. As well, I know my ability to form good research questions and background research skills are something I have been wanting to further develop because I have struggled with these sorts of assignments before so I am glad I get the opportunity to work on those in this class. I helped in developing the research question and am writing the section of the research assignment in which we explain why we are addressing our specific question and how that relates to the gap in knowledge pertaining to the topic of interest. I also wrote the data summary because I am the most familiar with the data set and offered to do so. I have also agreed that for the duration of the project, I will take charge of the data analysis (we each picked our strengths and determined which parts of the project we will each be responsible for).       I have done research projects in statistics and research classes before so this is fairly similar to that. It is quite different from writing I’ve done in typical writing classes because you have to be objective and explicitly disclaim all aspects of your research in depth.       I was initially worried about finding preliminary research, but once I started looking for articles I began finding a lot which support the need for research on pollinators and the introduction of native bee species. At first I was worried that I couldn’t find any research specifically on the introduction of companies which rent bees/pollinators to individuals and farms to increase population, but then I realized that this means there is a gap in information which is good for our research question.       I think the thing I am confused about most, is the formation of the research question. I wanted to do a more indepth important question, but with the data we have currently we have to explore a more shallow question and I am not entirely confident it is enough for your standards. However, we haven’t explicitly gone over what you expect from our question in class so I’m not sure either way. To address this confusion, I talked with Denise about what we have as options for our research question and we decided on the best one we could formulate. As well, I was hoping to receive feedback on our research question assignment which lets us know if were on the right path or not. Completed this objective with the group ggplot2 visualization assignment, by presenting and watching presentations.    Covered this with the measurement type handout.    Also covered this with the group ggplot2 visualization assignment.    Not sure if we covered this explicitly in class, but the reading in R for Data Science of chapters 4-6 and 10, covered this information.   We’ve somewhat achieved this through the few major assignments we’ve completed so far. I've used R before so some of the simple operators I remember, but it's probably been 2 years since I've used it so the actual syntax for functions is something I'm still relearning. I never learned how to really manipulate a data set in R before so I am definitely enjoying playing around with those functions. So far I've learned how to add and remove columns, join separate data sets and create new data sets. I also never ran a chi-squared test so I learned how to do that and learned that it is shockingly simple compared to running it in excel or by hand. I didn't use them, but I also learned about tibbles which I didn't know were a thing and seem like they could be useful in certain situations. I found Etiowo’s presentation very beneficial, in that it was the first time I got an actual inside presentation on the career path and work of a data analysts. I personally am working towards a career in data analyzation, so learning about Etiowo’s specific career path was quite helpful in creating a definite idea of what to expect.       His answer to my question about advice for aspiring data analysts was actually very useful in that I was planning on just taking any job I could find in any field post graduation. But his advice to pick a field that interests me, since data analysts are needed in almost every field, got me thinking about what type of data I actually want to be working with. I am still curious about the process of becoming a “senior” data analyst and if there are any differences between senior and entry level other than experience? As well, how long it took him to become a senior analyst. Otherwise, I really appreciated Etiowo taking the time to do the presentation and you setting it up because it kind of relieved a bit of the stress of not knowing what to expect post graduation. I wouldn’t say a whole lot has changed in my understanding of data visualization. I think I have a stronger grasp on determining the tests you need to run based off your data. I also have a stronger grasp on the structure of a research paper, since I am writing two of them this quarter. My knowledge on R has been refreshed but not necessarily enhanced, I didn’t really like the structure of the book. I benefited more from searching the problems I was facing in R online because the answers were more complete there. Overall, this course so far has solidified my understanding of data visualization through the contextualization of concepts I previously knew into an actual research paper and analysis. A data visualization should convey the most important information in as approachable of a format as possible. This often means, over specifying for people who don’t have much experience looking at data visualizations, as well as, keeping it simple and not adding too many extraneous elements that clutter the visual and confuse the viewer. Sizing is key, often with misleading visuals the size of elements (such as bars or lines) is used to visually trick the user into assuming there is a trend when there isn’t, or vise versa.       The use of photos is often more impactful than graphs in that they can evoke an emotional response more effectively, to the data. As well, people who don’t work with data visuals can understand the purpose or message of photos more easily than a graph in which they may not be familiar with. The downside to using images, is the exact measurement being displayed is often lost. An image of global warming effects on glaciers is must less accurate than a graph depicting the exact measurements of the decline/effects. Therefore, urgency in data or the call to action of a visual can be minimized in the use of photos over more accurate forms of visualization. It's a requirement for my major and one of the few classes within my major that was actually available and I was able to get into. Also just the idea of the topics of the combination between data and visual are interesting to me.     A deeper understanding as to what data visualization is. I want to know how to apply data visualization to my future career and it's usage in my life.    I am a kinesthetic and visual learner. Retaining information through speeches is not my strongest suit. Well, I actually used R before when I took Linear Algebra so my expectations in this class for it to reality are relatively the same. I will say that before I ever used R, I expected R to be a little more complex and remind me of coding (not that I've ever coding thought I want to learn) and it seemed to be exactly what I expected.     For the personal timeline, I didn't realize that you didn't want any drawing (oops). The challenges I came across was deciding what information to include and what not to include. For the news graphic, I think my group and I had confusion as to how to display 47 percent of people not wanting to go to Church on Eastern into different displays of data visualization.     P.S. I forgot what group I was in when doing the news graphic but I remember talking at 47 percent of people weren't going to church.    For the timeline, I settled with major events and things that seemed of value to who I am today.    With the news graphic, my group and I decided to go with the most common way of displaying a type of data with percentages such as the pie chart. If we're talking about my thoughts specifically in relation to the student success project, I found my success being weighed by my experiences and not too much on GPA. Having experiences that would help with getting into my own career field is more prioritized.    I know many are focus the same as me and looking for experience. So for many to be successful is being able to find a connection in things like research study, study abroad, CBLR, just anything that could push them more in their chosen direction. Also, I do think many are very driven with GPA and uses GPA as guidance.    I haven't really done much high-impact practices but I am planning many of them. I'm looking into research studies, study abroad (due to COVID I had to push mine to next summer), and I will probably be doing capstone towards the end of next year. I do however, want to do internship or volunteer so I'll be looking into those too. Writing a research question is more condense than other forms of writing. It takes a lot more critical thinking because your question has to be able to provide enough details to give direction. Other writings tend to just be more free form and there is more space to provide detail and information.    The learning of components that make up a graph/chart and the HIP project. These seem easier to understand because there is a lot of details that are shown with it. Just the layout and the information are easily readable.    Rstudio because some of the functions are not working but I tend to figure it out after a while. I also think the research project is challenging. I think there's still just a lot I don't understand about this project.    I'm going to work on trying to understand R more. I am also going to work on understanding the project by looking over all the information again. 1. Using the zoom to go over questions and breakdown the steps of the assignments is going well. Also, splitting into groups is good too because it gives us time to have you answer our question at the moment.         2. I feel as if we're kind of on different agendas. With just having other classes that also have large workload, it's a little overwhelming and the assignments I work on are not really the assignments you're going over in the zoom. It's nice to get broken up into break out groups because it lets me focus on what I was focusing on and be able to produce the questions I need for it. I just prefer to finish one assignment before moving on to the next rather than doing half of each assignment. When exploring R, I was looking into how to use it and all its functions because I really had no idea how to code still. Since working in R, I learned to filter through data set and how 'filter' is used for rows and 'select' is used for columns. I also found out about the different themes I could use for Sankey plots and that there was a thing called Sankey Wheel. I also quickly learn about the usage of different packages. However, through the process, R did begin to be slow which made it hard to explore. I think this course has deepened my critical thinking skills by forcing me to see the large picture of smaller scales. Understanding why the objective is important and correlating it one's own experiences help me to understand better on the subject matter. Also, it had me look at factors I was unfamiliar with but having to make sense of how it context matters. Overall, I had to learn this complex yet rewarding (coding) system, where I couldn't just type in a bunch of random things but really had to understand the functions of each code and why they work the way that they do. Since starting this course, I've started off at a slow pace. I didn't understand much of the coding process but data visualization was something I was familiar with. Over the few couple of weeks, I found myself being resourceful and quite motivated in the fact that I chose this class because I wanted to learn. Now I am capable of coding, thinking critically about the outcomes of data visualization, and if unsure, I am prepared and skilled enough to find answers to my questions. I am a visual person, so data visualization is something I use quite often in my life but now I can see the structure more clearly by understanding coding.\""
